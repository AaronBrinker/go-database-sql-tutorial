This is a tutorial on [Go's database/sql package](http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/). 
The package's documentation tells you
what everything does, but it doesn't tell you how to use the package. Many of us
find ourselves wishing for a quick-reference and a "getting started"
orientation. This website is an attempt to provide that. Contributions are
welcome; please send pull requests
[here](https://github.com/VividCortex/go-database-sql-tutorial).
