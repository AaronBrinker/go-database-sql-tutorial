This is a tutorial on Go's [database/sql package](http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/).
The package's documentation tells you what everything does, but it
doesn't tell you how to use the package. Many of us wished for a quick-reference and a "getting started"
orientation. This site is an attempt to provide that. Contributions are welcome.
